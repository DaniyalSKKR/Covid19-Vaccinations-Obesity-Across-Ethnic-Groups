# # Final Project CS418
# 
# 
#
#
# 
# ***Project Introduction:***
# 
#     We will be analyzing correlations between two datasets, namely COVID vaccinations that surround the crux of the epidemic as well as the frequency of other viruses that occured during this time frame. Information will be extrapolated from 2020 to 2023 in the United States.
# 
#     Information will be analyzed by end of week increments citing this consistency in both data sets for more granularity in observations. Coarser data will be extracted on an annual level.
# 
#     For those afflicated with COVID, we will make observations in regards how ethnic denominations may be affected by the epidemic as well as population density. Are certain groups more susceptible? How about age?
# 
#     Is there correlations between vaccination rates and pathogen spread, and beyond Covid-19, has there been any effect on those afflicted by other respiratoy illnesses?
# 
#     Additionally, how effective has bivalent vaccinations performed in diseased populations? This can be observed concurrently with COVID and disjointly.
# 
# ***Any changes:***
# 
#     The temporal observations have remained consistent, noting the seasonal distributions and changes in bivalent vaccinations and other vacinations. Furthermore, investigations on ethnic demographics will be a significant part of data analysis in regards to observing those afflicted with disease.
# 
#     Our comparative analysis will provide more data on how vaccinations that occur in parallel with the existence of other diseases changes over a bounded timeset. The specific demographic analysis will be more centralized on its relation to COVID vaccinations which remains consistent with the intial intended procedure.

# ## `Exploratory data analysis(EDA):`
# ### EDA Objectives:
# 1. **Trend Analysis**: Examine how COVID-19 cases and vaccination rates have changed over time.
# 2. **Demographic Analysis**: Analyze vaccination rates across different demographics to identify disparities.
# 3. **Correlation Analysis**: Investigate potential correlations between COVID-19 case surges and changes in vaccination rates.
# 
# Let's start with the EDA by visualizing the trends of COVID-19 cases and vaccination rates over time and then across different demographics. We'll look at the overall vaccination rate trend first and then examine the rates across different racial/ethnic groups.

# ## `Machine Learning analysis:`
# 1. **Feature Selection**: Choosing relevant features for the ML model, including demographic indicators, COVID-19 case numbers, and temporal features.
# 2. **Model Development**: Selecting and training an ML model to analyze the impact of COVID-19 case increases on vaccination rates among different demographics.
# 3. **Model Evaluation**: Comparing the model's predictions to a baseline, assessing its performance, and interpreting the results to derive actionable insights.
# 
# ### Feature Selection
# I will select features that are likely to influence vaccination rates, including:
# - **Temporal Features**: `week_start` (converted to a numerical format), to capture time trends.
# - **COVID-19 Case Numbers**: `lab_tot_positive` or `lab_pct_positive`, to measure the impact of COVID-19 spread.
# - **Demographic Indicators**: One-hot encoded `Race/Ethnicity_*` columns, to assess disparities among different demographics.
# 
# ### Model Development
# For simplicity and interpretability, I will start with a Linear Regression model. This model will help us understand the relationship between our selected features and vaccination rates.
# 
# ### Preparing the Data
# - Convert `week_start` to a numerical format by calculating the number of days since the first date in the dataset.
# - Select the outcome variable: `Vaccine Series Completed Percent`.
# - Removing Rows with Missing `y` Values: This is the simplest approach, where we only keep rows that have a non-missing outcome variable.
# - Imputation: Replace missing values with a statistic, such as the mean or median of the column. For the outcome variable, this approach might not always be suitable, as it could introduce bias.
# - Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
# 
# Given the nature of our analysis, removing rows with missing `y` values might be the most straightforward and least biased approach.
# 
# The Mean Squared Error (MSE) for the test set, after removing rows with missing outcome variable values and retraining the Linear Regression model, is approximately 0.090. This metric quantifies the average squared difference between the observed actual outcomes and the outcomes predicted by the model. A lower MSE indicates a better fit of the model to the data.
# 
# ### Interpretation
# - **Interpretation**: The obtained MSE can be used to evaluate the performance of the model. However, understanding its implications requires context, such as the variance of the `Vaccine Series Completed Percent` across the dataset and comparisons to baseline models or other ML models.
# - **Model Coefficients**: Analyzing the coefficients of the Linear Regression model could provide insights into how different features, including demographic indicators and COVID-19 case numbers, impact vaccination rates.
# - **Improvements**: I am going to consider exploring other models to improve model performance.

# #### Creating a baseline and calculating it's mse to compare it to the trained model:
# In the context of our analysis, a baseline model serves as a simple reference point to compare the performance of our more complex machine learning models. It helps us understand the added value of our model in predicting vaccination completion percentages. For regression task at hand:
# 
# 1. **Mean Model**: Predicts the mean of the target variable for all instances, regardless of the input features. This model's performance can be measured using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), providing a basic benchmark for improvement.
# 
# ### Establishing a Baseline
# For our analysis, the **mean model** serves as a straightforward and intuitive baseline. We'll calculate the mean of the `Vaccine Series Completed Percent` from the training data and use this as a constant prediction for all instances in the test set. We can then calculate the MSE of this baseline to compare it against the MSE from our linear regression model.
# 
# ### Calculating the Baseline Performance
# The baseline MSE offers a point of comparison for evaluating the linear regression model. If the MSE of the linear regression model is significantly lower than the baseline MSE, this indicates that our model provides a better fit to the data than the simple average, thereby offering more precise predictions about vaccination rates.
# 

# %%
# Calculate the mean of the target variable from the training data
mean_vaccination_rate = y_train_cleaned.mean()

# Create an array of the same mean value to serve as our baseline predictions
baseline_predictions = np.full(shape=y_test_cleaned.shape, fill_value=mean_vaccination_rate)

# Calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) for the baseline model
baseline_mse = mean_squared_error(y_test_cleaned, baseline_predictions)

# Display the baseline MSE

# %% [markdown]
# #### Training the model, making predictions and printing out mse to compare to baseline:

# %%

# Re-initialize and re-train the Linear Regression model on the cleaned data
model_cleaned = LinearRegression()
model_cleaned.fit(X_train_cleaned, y_train_cleaned)

# Predict on the testing set
y_pred_cleaned = model_cleaned.predict(X_test_cleaned)

# Calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) for the test set with cleaned data
mse_cleaned = mean_squared_error(y_test_cleaned, y_pred_cleaned)

# Display the MSE

# To gain insights into how the increase in COVID-19 cases and demographic factors influence vaccination rates, we'll examine the coefficients of the trained Linear Regression model. These coefficients quantify the relationship between each feature and the target variable, `Vaccine Series Completed Percent`, giving us a direct interpretation of their influence.
# 
# ### Analyzing Model Coefficients
# 
# 1. **Coefficient Interpretation**: For continuous features like `days_since_start` and `lab_tot_positive`, the coefficient value indicates the expected change in the vaccination completion percentage for a one-unit increase in the feature, holding all other features constant. For binary features resulting from one-hot encoding (e.g., demographic groups), the coefficient represents the difference in the vaccination completion percentage compared to the baseline category (which was dropped during one-hot encoding), again holding other variables constant.
# 
# 2. **Significance**: The magnitude and sign of each coefficient provide insights into the feature's impact. Positive coefficients indicate a direct relationship with vaccination rates, while negative coefficients suggest an inverse relationship.
# 
# Let's retrieve and interpret the coefficients of our Linear Regression model.
# 
# The coefficients of our Linear Regression model provide the following insights into the relationship between the features and the `Vaccine Series Completed Percent`:
# 
# 1. **Demographic Indicators**:
#    - The `Race/Ethnicity_Other, non-Latinx` group shows a positive coefficient of 0.190, suggesting a higher vaccination completion percentage compared to the baseline demographic group, holding all other variables constant.
#    - Conversely, the `Race/Ethnicity_Black, non-Latinx` group has a negative coefficient (-0.121), indicating a lower vaccination completion percentage compared to the baseline, all else being equal.
#    - Other demographic groups (`Asian, non-Latinx`, `Latinx`, and `White, non-Latinx`) also show positive coefficients but with smaller magnitudes, suggesting varying degrees of influence on vaccination rates.
# 
# 2. **Temporal Feature (`days_since_start`)**:
#    - The positive coefficient (0.000542) implies that as time progresses, there's a slight increase in the vaccination completion percentage, which could reflect the overall trend of vaccination rollout over time.
# 
# 3. **COVID-19 Case Numbers (`lab_tot_positive`)**:
#    - The very small positive coefficient (0.000026) indicates that higher numbers of COVID-19 positive cases are slightly associated with an increase in vaccination completion rates, though the effect size is minimal.
# 
# 4. **Significance and Impact**:
#    - The largest impacts on vaccination rates, according to this model, come from demographic factors, particularly for the `Other, non-Latinx` and `Black, non-Latinx` groups, highlighting disparities in vaccination rates among different demographics.
#    - The effect of time and COVID-19 case numbers on vaccination rates is present but relatively minor compared to the impact of demographic factors.
# 
# ### Next Steps:
# Given these findings, targeted initiatives to increase vaccination rates could focus on demographic groups identified as having lower vaccination completion percentages.
# - Alternative modeling approaches, such as logistic regression for binary outcomes to potentially uncover non-linear relationships or interactions between features.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Key Interpretations and Implications:
# 
# 1. **Demographic Disparities**:
#    - **Other, non-Latinx**: The most significant positive influence on vaccination rates suggests that this group, relative to the baseline demographic, has higher vaccination completion rates. This could indicate successful outreach or higher acceptance rates within this group. Public health strategies targeting other groups might learn from approaches used with this demographic.
#    - **Black, non-Latinx**: The negative coefficient points to lower vaccination rates in this group compared to the baseline, underscoring the need for targeted public health messaging and vaccination initiatives that address the specific concerns and barriers faced by Black, non-Latinx communities.
#    - Other demographic groups also show varying degrees of influence, highlighting the nuanced landscape of vaccination acceptance and access across different demographics. Tailoring strategies to each group's unique context and barriers could improve overall vaccination rates.
# 
# 2. **Temporal Trends**:
#    - The positive coefficient associated with `days_since_start` suggests a gradual increase in vaccination rates over time. This trend likely reflects the expanding availability of vaccines and the cumulative effect of ongoing public health campaigns. Continuous efforts are necessary to maintain and accelerate this positive trend.
# 
# 3. **COVID-19 Case Numbers**:
#    - The small positive coefficient for `lab_tot_positive` suggests that increases in COVID-19 cases have a marginal association with higher vaccination rates. This could indicate a reactive increase in vaccination efforts following surges in cases, but the small magnitude of this effect suggests that case surges alone are not a strong driver of vaccination uptake. Proactive, sustained vaccination campaigns may be more effective than relying on reactive increases following case surges.
# 
# ### Strategic Implications for Public Health:
# - **Targeted Initiatives**: The disparities among demographic groups highlight the need for targeted vaccination initiatives. Understanding and addressing the barriers specific to groups with lower vaccination rates are crucial.
# - **Enhanced Outreach and Education**: For demographics showing resistance or lower rates of vaccination, such as the Black, non-Latinx community, enhanced outreach programs, community engagement, and education efforts could help address concerns and misinformation.
# - **Monitoring and Adaptation**: The ongoing analysis of vaccination trends and their correlation with COVID-19 case numbers can inform adaptive strategies that preemptively address potential surges in cases through increased vaccination efforts.
# 
# ### Conclusion and Next Steps:
# This analysis underscores the importance of demographic considerations and the dynamic nature of vaccination campaigns in response to COVID-19. For public health officials and policymakers, these insights can inform more effective, equitable vaccination initiatives that are responsive to community needs and changing circumstances.
# 
# Further investigation could include:
# - **Exploring Interaction Effects**: Analyzing how demographic factors interact with temporal trends might reveal more complex dynamics influencing vaccination rates.
# - **Alternative Modeling Approaches**: Using models that capture non-linear relationships or interactions could provide additional insights into factors influencing vaccination rates.

# To visualize the regression analysis we performed, especially for a linear regression model, I have ploted the actual versus predicted values to assess how well the model fits the data. 
# 
# This plot includes a dashed line representing perfect predictions (where actual values equal predicted values) to help visually assess the model's accuracy. Points close to this line indicate accurate predictions, while points farther away represent larger discrepancies between the model's predictions and the actual data.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Reflection:
# - The hardest part I encountered was data cleaning and making the input features for the machine learning model as I had some missing values for some reason and they were hard to figure out how to take care of them.
# - My inital insights are that we need to focus on the minority of the african-americans for the vaccination campaigns.
# - Going forward I do not thing that there are any major problems that me and my team is facing.
# - There are concrete results that are from my model and they are displayed in the notebook.
# - I think we are on track with the project.
# - Yes I think it is worth proceeding with the project as we have enough data to support our hypothesis and make predictions based on the data that we have which will indicate the ethnicity of the target advertisments.
# 
# ### Next Steps:
# Given these findings, targeted initiatives to increase vaccination rates could focus on demographic groups identified as having lower vaccination completion percentages.
# - Alternative modeling approaches, such as logistic regression for binary outcomes to potentially uncover non-linear relationships or interactions between features.
# 
# ### Any changes:
# - There are no changes to the scope of the project and we will proceed as intened for the project.
